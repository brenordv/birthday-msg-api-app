# Birthday Quote API
## Api

This is the API for a silly project I've made.
The application will return a random quote in either Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br, default) or English (en-us).

## How to use
### Local
```shell
python run_locally.py
```
Access: `http://localhost:5001`

### Live (@ Heroku) 
Url: `https://raccoon-ninja-birthday-api.herokuapp.com/`
(Heroku might put the API to sleep, so you might need to try a couple of times)

## Ok. Got it...but why?
For fun. The api was made using Python (Flask) and is published on Heroku (@ https://raccoon-ninja-birthday-api.herokuapp.com/).
I work for a medium size company that's always hiring new employees, which means new birthday cards to write something nice and sign. 
I'm just adding some automation to the process. (I know, it's not the most empathic, personal or human thing to do, but was fun coding all this.)
